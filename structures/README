Structures of amylose-chains as used in the following publications:

 - J. Kussmann and C. Ochsenfeld,
   "Linear-scaling method for calculating nuclear magnetic resonance
    chemical shifts using gauge-including atomic orbitals within Hartree-Fock
    and density-functional theory",
   J. Chem. Phys. 127, 054103 (2007).

 - J. Kussmann and C. Ochsenfeld,
   "A density matrix-based method for the linear-scaling calculation of
    dynamic second- and third-order properties at the Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham
    density functional theory levels",
   J. Chem. Phys., submitted for publication (2007).


Original structures have been obtained by the SWEET tool
(http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/spec/sweet2/doc/index.php), sequence has been
reordered by applying the reverse Cuthill-McKee algorithm onto the connectivity
matrix.
